Design systems enable teams to build better products faster by making design reusable—reusability makes scale possible. This is the heart and primary value of design systems. A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.

Regardless of the technologies and tools behind them, a successful design system follows these guiding principles:

- **It’s consistent**. The way components are built and managed follows a predictable pattern.
- **It’s self-contained**. This design system is treated as a standalone dependency.
- **It’s reusable**. These components are built so they can be reused in many contexts.
- **It’s accessible**. Applications built with this design system are usable by as many people as possible, no matter how they access the web.
- **It’s robust**. No matter the product or platform to which this design system is applied, it performs with grace and minimal bugs.
